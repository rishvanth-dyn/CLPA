Cloud-Based Personalized Learning Assistant (CPLA):

		The Cloud-Based Personalized Learning Assistant (CPLA) is an intelligent online learning platform that provides personalized study recommendations based on a user's interests, skill level, and progress. It uses cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the learning experience.

We built the system using:

	* Frontend: React.js (to create the user interface).
	* Backend: Node.js + Express.js (to handle requests and process data).
	* Cloud Services:
		- Azure AI Services (to provide personalized course recommendations).
		- Azure Blob Storage (to store and retrieve learning materials).
		- Azure Cosmos DB (to save user progress and history).

This project makes learning easier, more efficient, and accessible from anywhere. In the future, it can be improved with voice-based learning, quizzes, and gamification to make studying more engaging.
